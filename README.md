Stock Profile enables search for stock information using the Tiingo Stock API, and the results are displayed in both tabular format and charts format
using HighCharts. It also provides news articles for the selected stock using the News API.

The server is built using Python and the Flask framework.

The application is deployed on AWS ElasticBeanstalk:
